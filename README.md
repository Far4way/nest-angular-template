# NestAngularTemplate

This repository serves as a template for projects using both Angular and Nest.js frameworks. It utilizes Nx to facilitate resource sharing, including a shared library that contains custom interfaces, constants, types, and DTOs.

## Features
- Nx Workspace: Efficiently manage and share resources within the project.
- Shared Library: Centralized location for all common project entities.

## Upcoming Enhancements
- ORM Integration: Planning to integrate [Mikro-Orm]([https://link-url-here.org](https://github.com/mikro-orm/mikro-orm)) for seamless database interactions.
- Additional Tools: More tools will be added to ensure a quick and easy start for new projects (Websockets Modules, Jwt Authentication layer with access and refresh tokens, Ngrx integration for ORM entities, ...).
